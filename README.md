# Chennai_Water_Management_NB

**NOTE:** If you cannot view the notebook on GitHub (there have been some failures in loading
notebooks lately) you can view this notebook
[here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/marxav0319/Chennai_Water_Management_NB/blob/master/Chennai%20Water%20Management%20Exploratory%20Analysis.ipynb).  I've also posted to
[kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/markxavier/chennai-water-management-exploratory-analysis).

An exploratory analysis of a dataset hosted on kaggle detailing water management in Chennai, India.
Initially my plan was to do an exploratory analysis and to build a model via machine learning
techniques, however I've decided that these two should be separate.  Therefore, for now, I'm just
working on the exploratory analysis in the notebook.  In the future, I may create a separate
notebook or script comparing several models.
