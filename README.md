# Chennai_Water_Management_NB

**NOTE:** If you cannot view the notebook on GitHub (there have been some failures in loading
notebooks lately) you can view this notebook
[here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/marxav0319/Chennai_Water_Management_NB/blob/master/Chennai%20Water%20Management%20Exploratory%20Analysis.ipynb)

An exploratory analysis of a dataset hosted on kaggle detailing water management in Chennai, India.
Initially my plan was to do an exploratory analysis and to build a model via machine learning
techniques, however I've decided that these two should be separate.  Therefore, for now, I'm just
working on the exploratory analysis in the notebook.  In the future, I may create a separate
notebook or script comparing several models.

I may have to restructure this notebook to make it flow better, I'll be reassessing the code and the
text I've written here in the near future and I'll do some clean-up.
